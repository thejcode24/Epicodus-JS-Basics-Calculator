##### Epicodus Section: HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery Basics  - Calculator

#### By Epicodus Lessons and re-typed by James Jung

## Description

This application is a demonstration of creating and using basic functions to create a very basic calculator and learning about 
the separation of the user-interface logic("front-end") and the business logic("backend"). 

Also, in order to practice basic HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery, I created a browser-based GUI for a very basic calculator that uses
CSS3 properties such as border-radius, transform, and box-shadow to make a more modern feel to the UI. Also, a sprinkle of regular 
expressions is used to substitute the 'x' sign for multiplication and the 'รท' sign for division when computing the values using 
JavaScript functions. 

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, with a sprinkle of regular expressions
